Fast Fourier Transform is an algorithm that, given a polynomial $P$ of degree $n = 2^k - 1$, returns the evaluation of that polynomial at points $w^0, w^1, ..., w^{n - 2}, w^{n - 1} = \mathcal{F}(P)$. That representation allows for fast evaluation of some operations on polynomials, for example: $\mathcal{F}(P \ast Q) = \mathcal{F}(P) \odot \mathcal{F}(Q)$. It is also possible to evaluate FFT in some rings $\mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p$ is some prime. In particular, $31$ is the $2^{23}$-th root of unity in the ring $\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{Z}{998244353}$.
