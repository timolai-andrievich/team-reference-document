To find strongly connected components:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Run DFS on the graph, keeping track of $T_{\text{out}}(u)$ - time DFS left $u$. Time is a global timer, increased every time DFS terminates.
  \item Let $G' = (V, E'), E' = \{(v, u) | (u, v) \in E\}$, i.e. graph with inverted edges.
  \item Run DFS on $G$, in decreasing order of $T_\text{out}$. The resulting trees will be strongly connected components of $G$.
\end{enumerate}
